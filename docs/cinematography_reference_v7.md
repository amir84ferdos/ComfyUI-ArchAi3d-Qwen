## SHOT SIZES (Distance from Subject)

### 1. Extreme Wide Shot (EWS) / Extreme Long Shot (ELS)
**Definition**: Makes subject appear small against their location
**Use Case**: Show subject from great distance, establish vast environment
**Effect**: Subject appears tiny, emphasizes scale and isolation

### 2. Establishing Shot
**Definition**: Opening shot that clearly shows location of action
**Use Case**: First shot of scene to establish location and environment
**Effect**: Provides spatial context, sets mood, gives time/situation clues

### 3. Wide Shot (WS) / Long Shot (LS)
**Definition**: Shows subject from top to bottom but not filling frame
**Use Case**: Show full body with surrounding environment
**Effect**: Balances subject and environment equally

### 4. Full Shot (FS)
**Definition**: Frames character head to toes, roughly filling frame
**Use Case**: Show complete subject with minimal environment
**Effect**: Focus on subject while showing entire body

### 5. Medium Long Shot (MLS) / 3/4 Shot
**Definition**: Shows subject from knees up
**Use Case**: Intermediate between full body and waist-up
**Effect**: Emphasizes upper body while showing some movement capability

### 6. Cowboy Shot / American Shot
**Definition**: Frames subject from mid-thighs up
**Use Case**: Originated in Westerns to show gun holsters
**Effect**: Action-oriented framing, shows hands and weapons

### 7. Medium Shot (MS)
**Definition**: Shows subject from waist up
**Use Case**: Standard dialogue and interaction framing
**Effect**: Balance between subject and environment, shows body language

### 8. Medium Close-Up (MCU)
**Definition**: Frames subject from chest/shoulders up
**Use Case**: Conversational scenes with some intimacy
**Effect**: Emphasizes facial expressions while showing some body language

### 9. Close-Up (CU)
**Definition**: Fills screen with subject's head/face
**Use Case**: Show emotional reactions and expressions
**Effect**: Emotions dominate the scene, creates intimacy

### 10. Choker
**Definition**: Frames face from above eyebrows to below mouth
**Use Case**: Extreme emotional intensity
**Effect**: Maximum facial detail, very tight and intimate

### 11. Extreme Close-Up (ECU)
**Definition**: Fills frame with tiny details (eyes, lips, objects)
**Use Case**: Show minute details otherwise difficult to see
**Effect**: Dramatic emphasis on specific small elements

## CAMERA ANGLES (Vertical Position)

### 1. Eye Level Shot
**Definition**: Camera level with subject's eyes
**Use Case**: Neutral perspective, standard dialogue
**Effect**: Little psychological effect, natural viewing

### 2. Shoulder Level Shot
**Definition**: Camera aligned with shoulder height
**Use Case**: Slightly lower perspective with reduced headroom
**Effect**: Actor's eyeline slightly above camera, subtle low angle feel

### 3. High Angle Shot
**Definition**: Camera physically higher than subject, looking down
**Use Case**: Show vulnerability or weakness
**Effect**: Makes subject appear small, weak, vulnerable, subordinate

### 4. Low Angle Shot
**Definition**: Camera well below eye level, looking up
**Use Case**: Show power and dominance
**Effect**: Makes subject appear stronger, more powerful, dominant

### 5. Overhead Shot / God's Eye View
**Definition**: Camera directly above subject, looking straight down
**Use Case**: Establish spatial relationships, show patterns
**Effect**: Omniscient perspective, shows comprehensive layout

### 6. Bird's Eye View
**Definition**: Very high overhead perspective
**Use Case**: Establish landscape and spatial relationships
**Effect**: Comprehensive environmental context, disorienting

### 7. Worm's Eye View
**Definition**: Camera at ground level looking up
**Use Case**: Child's or pet's perspective
**Effect**: Extreme sense of looking from below, powerlessness

### 8. Dutch Angle / Canted Angle / Tilt
**Definition**: Camera slanted to one side, tilted horizon
**Use Case**: Show disorientation, psychological instability
**Effect**: Creates tension, unease, destabilized mental state

## CAMERA MOVEMENTS (Dynamic Motion)

### 1. Pan
**Definition**: Camera pivots left/right on horizontal axis from fixed base
**Use Case**: Reveal larger horizontal space, follow horizontal action
**Effect**: Smooth horizontal reveal, natural head-turning motion

### 2. Tilt
**Definition**: Camera pivots up/down on vertical axis from fixed base
**Use Case**: Reveal vertical space, follow vertical action
**Effect**: Smooth vertical reveal, looking up/down motion

### 3. Dolly / Dolly In / Dolly Out
**Definition**: Camera moves forward or backward on track
**Use Case**: Move toward/away from subject smoothly
**Effect**:
- **Dolly In**: Increases intimacy, emphasis, tension
- **Dolly Out**: Reveals context, creates distance, shows scale

### 4. Truck / Tracking (Lateral)
**Definition**: Camera moves left/right along track (lateral dolly)
**Use Case**: Follow subject moving horizontally, reveal space laterally
**Effect**: Parallel movement maintains distance while revealing new space

### 5. Pedestal / Boom Up / Boom Down
**Definition**: Entire camera raises or lowers vertically on axis
**Use Case**: Adjust height while maintaining framing
**Effect**: Different from tilt - entire camera moves vs. just pivoting

### 6. Arc Shot / 360 Tracking
**Definition**: Camera moves in circular motion around subject
**Use Case**: Reveal subject from all angles, dynamic emphasis
**Effect**: Immersive, reveals subject dimensionally, dramatic

### 7. Tracking Shot
**Definition**: Camera follows subject as they move
**Use Case**: Immerse viewers in character's journey
**Effect**: Creates connection and momentum, dynamic storytelling

### 8. Zoom
**Definition**: Focal length changes while camera remains stationary
**Use Case**: Quick size adjustment without camera movement
**Effect**:
- **Zoom In**: Quick emphasis, different feel than dolly
- **Zoom Out**: Quick reveal, flattens perspective

## V7 ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES

### 1. Professional Shot Size Terminology
Replace current distance system with cinematography standards:
- Extreme Wide Shot (EWS)
- Wide Shot (WS)
- Full Shot (FS)
- Medium Shot (MS)
- Close-Up (CU)
- Extreme Close-Up (ECU)

### 2. Expanded Camera Angles
Add missing professional angles:
- Bird's Eye View (direct overhead)
- Worm's Eye View (ground level up)
- Dutch Angle (tilted horizon)
- Shoulder Level (between eye and low)
- High Angle (current "top-down" renamed)
- Eye Level (current "front view" clarified)

### 3. Complete Camera Movements
Expand current movements to match industry terms:
- Pan (left/right pivot) - **already have**
- Tilt (up/down pivot) - **already have**
- Dolly (forward/back track) - **already have**
- Truck (left/right track) - **need to add**
- Pedestal (up/down raise) - **need to add**
- Arc/Orbit (circular) - **already have**
- Zoom (focal length change) - **need to distinguish from dolly**

### 4. Enhanced Lens Categories
Expand to match cinematography focal lengths:
- Ultra Wide (14-24mm)
- Wide Angle (24-35mm)
- Normal (50mm) - **already have**
- Portrait (85mm)
- Telephoto (100-200mm)
- Macro - **already have**

### 5. Maintain V6 Features
- Vantage Point Mode (Interior Focus)
- Material Presets
- Quality Presets
- Plural-safe grammar
- Chinese prompt generation
- Focus Transition Mode
- Detailed explanations

---

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Backwards Compatibility
- V7 should support both new cinematography terms AND legacy v6 terms
- Users upgrading from v6 should see familiar options alongside new professional terms

### Chinese Translation
All new cinematography terms need Chinese equivalents:
- Extreme Wide Shot → 超广角镜头
- Bird's Eye View → 鸟瞰视角
- Truck Movement → 横移镜头
- Pedestal → 升降镜头

### Prompt Structure
Maintain proven structure:
`Next Scene: [Chinese camera instructions]`

### System Prompts
Preserve plural-safe, object-agnostic language for both single and multiple subjects.
